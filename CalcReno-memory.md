# CalcReno - Project Overview

## What is CalcReno?

CalcReno is a mobile app designed to help people plan and budget their home renovation projects. Think of it as a smart calculator that takes the guesswork out of figuring out how much material you'll need and how much your renovation will cost.

## What Does It Do?

The app helps you:

- **Create renovation projects** - Start a new project for any room or space you want to renovate
- **Design room layouts** - Draw your room shape (rectangular or L-shaped) and add details like doors and windows
- **Calculate materials automatically** - The app figures out exactly how much paint, drywall, flooring, insulation, and other materials you'll need based on your room dimensions
- **Estimate costs** - See the total cost of materials for your renovation project
- **Manage multiple projects** - Keep track of all your renovation projects in one place
- **Export your plans** - Save and share your renovation calculations

## Is It Web or Mobile?

CalcReno is primarily a **mobile app** available for:
- **iOS** (iPhone and iPad)
- **Android** (phones and tablets)

The app can also work on web browsers, but it's designed and optimized for mobile devices so you can use it on-the-go while you're at your renovation site.

## What's the Goal?

The goal of CalcReno is to make renovation planning accessible and accurate for everyone:

- **For homeowners and DIYers** - Get accurate material estimates without needing to be a construction expert
- **For small contractors** - Quickly calculate material needs and costs for client projects
- **Save time and money** - Avoid buying too much or too little material by getting precise calculations

The app eliminates the need for manual calculations, spreadsheets, and guesswork when planning renovations.

## Current Status

**CalcReno is currently in beta phase on the App Store.** This means the app is available for download and use, but it's still being refined based on user feedback. Users can try it out, provide feedback, and help shape the final version.

## Future Plans

CalcReno is part of a larger vision to create a complete renovation ecosystem:

### Short-term Plans
- **Free launch period** - The app will be free for the first 3-4 months to build a user base
- **User feedback integration** - Collecting feedback and bug reports to improve the app
- **Subscription model** - After the free period, introducing subscription tiers:
  - **Free tier** - Basic features with limited projects
  - **Pro tier** - All features for a single app ($5-10/month)
  - **Expert tier** - Access to all apps in the ecosystem with team features ($50-55/month)

### Long-term Vision
- **4-app ecosystem** - CalcReno is one of four planned apps (2 mobile, 2 web) for the renovation market
- **Integration with RenoTimeline** - A companion app that helps manage renovation timelines and schedules
- **Portfolio website** - A central hub where users can manage their account, subscriptions, and access all apps
- **AI-powered features** - Automation and smart suggestions to make renovation planning even easier
- **Team collaboration** - Features for contractors and teams to work together on projects

The ultimate goal is to provide a complete toolkit for anyone involved in home renovation, from planning and budgeting to scheduling and execution.
